## PLEASE READ CAREFULLY TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN THE APP

1) Please use your own Google API key with "Javascript Maps API" enabled in the google account console. I have my own key but I cannot use it here as it is being used in another project.
2) Once you have the key add it into the environment.prod file in 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' variable.
3) Also, change the api key in the 'src/index.html' in the google script tag.


## HOW TO SERVE THE APP

1) Setup an angular environment with the latest node (14.17.0) and latest angular cli (12.1) on the machine globally.
2) Run 'npm install' on the project root directory.
3) ng serve -o
